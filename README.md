This project uses a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between customer behavior and their yearly spending. The goal is to determine which factors, such as time spent on the app or website and membership length, are the best predictors of how much a customer will spend.

The project involves:

Modeling: Building a regression model using both statsmodels and scikit-learn.

Inference: Calculating confidence intervals for the model's coefficients to understand the significance of each factor.

Interpretation: Visualizing the model's predictions and uncertainty to draw meaningful conclusions.
